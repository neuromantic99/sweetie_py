% Pipeline to generate the structure containing all the information
% (behaviour and imaging about a mouse.

% Requires the functions: behaviourParser, imagingParser, dF_percentile,
% running_speed
% 
% set 'imagingPath' as the path to where all the suite2p processed imaging
% information is stored. Each mouse should have its own folder called after
% the name of the mouse. Otherwise the folder structure in this directory  
% is irrelevant as all information about the mouse is contained in the dat
% file

% set 'behaviourPath' as the path corre2sponding to the variable 'outPath'
% in the python function 'workflow_behav.py'. Again mice must be in a
% folder with their name but folder structure does not matter otherwise.

% set 'savePath' as the path where the final structures will be saved.
% data is saved as a mat file with the behaviour and imaging data seperate.
% the pipeline function can also be used within matlab to return the
% structure 'data' containing both imaging and behaviour

% all of these paths must end with a '/' this can be responsible for 
% a variety of errors

% shift the imaging behaviour into the imaging structure, allign to the
